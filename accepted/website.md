# Summary

Build a PhRUG website. Use GitHub pages for minimum cost and friction.
If someone acquires or renews pinoyrb.org, we can point it to the Github pages URL.

# Motivation

We want a "check out this URL to get the latest community news and activities" url.
It'll be a lot easier to attract new members if we have this.
Over time, and especially if we regularly publish community activities on this site,
this will have better SEO than our other online presence platforms (meetup.com,
Google Groups, Facebook page).

# Details

We need 1 or more people to run the site and regularly update it with:
- meetup announcements
- meetup synopsis, pictures, and links to YouTube recordings

We'll use Github Pages and phrug.github.io so that we do not have to pay for domain registration.

# Drawbacks

Maintaining the static site takes a bit more work than using a CMS.

# Alternatives

Use the meetup page: https://www.meetup.com/ruby-phil/ - not free but sponsored by Aelogica
Use the google groups page: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-phil
Use the Facebook page: https://web.facebook.com/phrug

# Unresolved questions

Should we use Jekyll, Middleman, or hand-crafted HTML and CSS?
Which theme should we use?
